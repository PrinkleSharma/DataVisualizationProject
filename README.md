# (CIS-602) Data Visualization Project

This repository includes the project proposal, updated research questions, and three different design iterations for the visualization. Design 1 is going to be the final visualization outcome of this project which intends to resolve research questions. Due to the change in visualization design (Pearson correlation -> parallel coordinates), design 1, to be prototyped, is not completed. Other two designs have been sketched as per Five Sheet Design rule and included in this repository.  

For prototype design, the design has been divided into iterations. More details are included in designs.html as comments.
The included dataset has now been filtered which comprises of 3 vehicles taking a uniform path on same day and time.
